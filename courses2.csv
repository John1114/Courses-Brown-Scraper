From this foundation, we will interrogate the ways that “race as biology” becomes mobilized in scientific and clinical discourses to justify and explain health disparities.

Case studies from North America mostly, but also Australia, South Africa, and other settler colonial societies will focus on historical archaeology’s contributions to illuminating settler colonialist strategies for establishing and maintaining settler sovereignty in light of concerns for decolonizing archaeological practices.

Recent research has identified universal mechanisms that regulate organismal aging and impact all organ systems. Several gene networks that can regulate the rate of aging and multiple age-related diseases have already been discovered. These mechanisms are conserved throughout evolution and many key insights have been garnered from simple model organisms. Manipulation of these networks has been achieved by diet, genetic engineering, and most recently, with drugs. The goal of modern medicine is to increase healthy survival, as opposed to simply longevity. It is now generally acknowledged that increasing health span – the fraction of our life spans free of frailty and debilitating chronic disease – has become a realistic goal.

Driven by biological processes set up to help us survive, our minds are constantly craving experiences and substances—from smartphones to romance to alcohol—and this craving leads to habit formation. This course will explore the behavioral and mental processes that foster craving and consequent habit formation, the impact these have on individual and societal health, and how we can “hack” our own neurobiological reward circuitry using practices such as mindfulness, to foster greater health and wellbeing.']"

Spurred by new instruments like the telescope, new technologies in printing and cartography, and unprecedented travel across the globe, knowledge about the universe increasingly expanded in this period to incorporate new discoveries and observations. Close analysis of several case studies will highlight how dramatic debates about these creatures played out in visual form in early modern Europe.']"

How can marginalized groups make their voices heard? The notion of subalternity has become crucial for transdisciplinary debates in the humanities. It describes not only a predicament of social, political, and economical oppression, but also one that imposes silence. How to break this silence? The risk is that of producing a representation that enters the dominant discourse while perpetuating the subaltern’s exclusion. Following the notion of subalternity from Antonio Gramsci to postcolonial studies and beyond, this seminar explores the conundrum of subaltern’s representation, its theoretical implications, and several strategies to address it.']"

Because of the embodied nature of performance, aspects of identity such as race, gender, and sexuality often play a visible role in the dynamics of the work.\nThe documentation of performance can exist in a wide range of formats, and usually endure for much longer than the performance itself. In this course, we will engage a “deep dive” on four distinct books that document performance.

We should have enough time to use this theory to prove two famous theorems of Thurston (about mapping classes and complex dynamics), and also go over a beautiful theorem of Maryam Mirzakhani, relating a natural flow for the hyperbolic structure to one that respects these maps of minimal dilatation.']"

On the other hand Leibniz is an amazingly down-to-earth critic of Locke: and a guide to the weaknesses of an over-simple empiricism.""]"

We examine classic theories of well-being: hedonistic, desire, and eudaimonistic theories, as well as new theoretical options (internalist and constitutivist theories). Then we consider different varieties of prudential goods, including happiness, meaningfulness, achievement.

How should a self-driving car behave when a crash is unavoidable? Are engineers responsible for the decisions of artificially-intelligent systems?

But over the next 20 years, he brings them both back (in different ways), convinced that they both play a crucial role in our thinking. (Hume will disagree.) 20th century philosophy has in different ways been embarrassed--or dismissive--of these same notions; and also in different ways (in Kripke, in Strawson, in Kit Fine) has brought them back.

Relatedly, we will ask questions about the roles of social values in biology.

As a preliminary question we ask what has to be assumed in order to make sense out of the main questions, and also of the idea of amounts of good.

Does self-deception require an intentional effort to disbelieve some home truth? And more broadly: What do these phenomena tell us about sound, rational belief and action?
